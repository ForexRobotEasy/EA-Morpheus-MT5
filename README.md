# EA Morpheus MT5

EA Morpheus MT5 is a trading expert advisor developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to execute a trading algorithm based on high price fluctuations in the EURUSD symbol. This code provides a sample implementation of the algorithm.

## Usage

1. Include the necessary libraries and define constants at the beginning of the code.
2. Initialize the trade, timeseries, and indicator objects.
3. Call the `OnStart` function to execute the trading algorithm.

## Algorithm

The algorithm implemented in this code follows these steps:

1. Initialize the trade object with the desired symbol and expert magic number.
2. Initialize the timeseries object with the desired symbol and period.
3. Initialize the indicator object with the desired symbol and period.
4. Check for high price fluctuations using the `CheckHighPriceFluctuations` function.
5. If high price fluctuations are detected, enter the market with pending orders using the `EnterMarket` function.
6. If no high price fluctuations are detected, wait for the next hour.

## Functions

### `OnStart`

This function is called to execute the trading algorithm. It initializes the trade, timeseries, and indicator objects. It then checks for high price fluctuations and enters the market with pending orders if detected.

### `CheckHighPriceFluctuations`

This function checks for high price fluctuations by calculating the price speed. It compares the current price with the previous price and checks if the price speed exceeds a threshold. Returns `true` if high price fluctuations are detected, `false` otherwise.

### `EnterMarket`

This function enters the market with pending orders. It calculates the buy stop and sell stop prices based on the current high and low prices. It then places the buy stop and sell stop orders with the specified lot size, stop loss, and take profit levels.
